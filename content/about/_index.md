## One Person

Freelancer. Traveler. FPV pilot. Tech explorer.

Unwilling to be arranged, choosing to create at my own pace.

---

## One Gentle Pot

The first work. An interactive poem.

Using real FPV footage to explore tenderness, distance, and融合.

## One Game

Future project. Still exploring.

Maybe an AI-driven narrative game.
Maybe a procedurally generated poetry world.
Maybe something completely different.

## One Dream

**Vision**: Deep thinking, crystallizing the cognitive coordinates of AI and games, exploring evolutionary paths.

This is not a content factory for rapid output.
This is a long-term creative experiment.

- **Deep Thinking** - Not superficial
- **Cognitive Crystallization** - Not information piling
- **Evolutionary Exploration** - Not sticking to the established
