## The Origin of Four "Ones"

**One Person**

Freelance. Love traveling. FPV filming.

Choosing this life is not escapism—it's recognizing I'm not suited to be arranged.

---

**One Gentle Pot**

The name of my first work. Also a metaphor for creation.

Tenderness is not weakness—it's the patience of slow cooking.
Like making a pot of rice, it can't be rushed.

---

**One Game**

Something I'll make in the future. Maybe a game, maybe not.

But "game" is a good word:
- Play - Freedom to explore
- Rules - Boundaries of creation
- Experience - Goal of expression

---

**One Dream**

A long-term vision.

Not the dream of "making a hit game in 3 months."
But the dream of "spending a lifetime exploring the boundaries of AI and games."

---

## Why AI + Games

**AI**: The most powerful tool of this era, and the greatest challenge.

I don't want to make "games that use AI to generate content."
I want to explore "how AI changes the essence of games."

**Games**: The freest medium.

Can be narrative, can be mechanics, can be pure experience.
No "should," only "could."

## The Necessity of Deep Thinking

This era is information overload.

Everyone is producing fast, consuming fast, forgetting fast.

I choose to **slow down**:
- Deep reading, not browsing headlines
- Deep thinking, not quick conclusions
- Deep creation, not mass production

This is not the most efficient way.
But it might be the only way to reach the end.

## Creation Principles of gameai.one

1. **Authentic > Perfect** - Use real materials, speak real thoughts
2. **Done > Perfect** - 2-hour completion > 2-month half-work
3. **Expression > Technology** - Convey emotion > Show off skills
4. **Long-term > Short-term** - Don't chase trends, only do meaningful things

## Next Steps

This is just the beginning.

There will be more works, more thinking, more exploration.

Maybe it will fail. Maybe the direction will change.
But I will keep recording, keep crystallizing.
