## Overview

"A Gentle Pot" is a 3-5 minute interactive poetry experience.

It uses real FPV footage with poetic text to explore tenderness, distance,
and the desire to merge.

## Motivation

> "Some things are cold as stone and refuse to melt.
> But home is a warm light, a pot of rice slowly simmering."

This work grew from reflections on family relationships:
- How to stay yourself while still entering a relationship?
- What is tenderness: compromise, or strength?
- How do we balance distance and intimacy?

---

## Implementation

- **Footage**: Personal FPV shots (quarry, garden, lakes)
- **Stack**: Pure web (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)
- **Interaction**: Touch or mouse click to drive the narrative
- **Build Time**: 2 hours (late night, Dec 18, 2025)
